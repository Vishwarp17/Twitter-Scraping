# Twitter-Scraping
This project involves scraping Twitter data using the snscrape library.

The scraped data includes the date, username, URL, reply count, language, source and retweet count.

The scraped data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

The data is then uploaded to a MongoDB database using PyMongo.

Finally, the scraped data can be downloaded in JSON or CSV format, or uploaded to MongoDB using Streamlit.

Tweet's scrapping app is a application that enables users to extract tweets from scattered tweet data, based on the search term,data range,count of tweets to be scraped , given by the user. This app helps the user get specific tweet details of their interest.
